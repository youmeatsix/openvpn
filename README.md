# Home Assistant OpenVPN Client Add-On

This is a Add-On for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) which enables to tunnel the communication of your 
Home Assistant server with the world through a VPN connection. 

This Add-On is interesting especially for those of you having a Google Home Mini and/or Amazon Alex integrated into your 
local Home Assistant but don't want to expose it into the world and already have a trustworthy remote server with a ssl 
certificate (acquired e.g. using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)).

The initial version of the Dockerfile to install the openvpn client was created by [TheSkorm](https://github.com/TheSkorm). 
Thanks for this. Base on his work, I've added the following:

* The Addon-On will now ship with its own website based on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
  in order to upload the certificates. 
* The client OpenVPN configuration is now possible via the Add-On configuration page.

# Installation

In order to install the Add-On, add the GitHub repository <https://github.com/larsklitzke/homeassistant-addons> to your
Home Assistant repositories. Afterwards, you'll find a new Add-On called `OpenVPNClient`. 

Enable the `OpenVPNClient` by adding a new `panel_iframe` entity  to your `configuration.yaml` with the following entry:

```
panel_iframe:
  openvpn:
    title: OpenVPN
    icon: mdi:cloud-check
    url: http://<server>:5000

```

with `<server>` pointing to the address of your Home Assistant server.
